**Consider the following API code snippet:**
 
import requests 
url = 'https://website.com/' 
 
 "# Get request"
 
result = requests.get(url) 
 
 "# Print request"
 
print(result.content.decode()) 
 
## Which status code will the server return? 
 
A. 403

B. 200

C. 401

D. 400

---


A status code of 403 in HTTP indicates a "Forbidden" response, which means that the server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. This could be due to insufficient permissions or other access restrictions.

If the server returns a 403 status code, it means the client (your code in this case) does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource at the given URL.

**A. 403**
