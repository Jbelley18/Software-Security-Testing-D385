**Consider the following API code snippet:**
 
import requests 
url = 'https://website.com/' 
 
# Get request 
 
result = requests.get(url) 
 
# Print request 
 
print(result.content.decode()) 
 
## Which status code will the server return? 
 
A. 403

B. 200

C. 401

D. 400

---

The code snippet sends a GET request to the specified URL using the requests.get method and then prints the content of the response using result.content.decode(). However, the code does not handle or check the HTTP status code directly.

By default, if the server returns a successful response, the HTTP status code 200 (OK) is usually returned. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 200.

The other options are not the expected status codes based on the given code and the absence of specific error handling:

A. 403 (Forbidden): This status code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. However, the code snippet doesn't involve any authentication or authorization mechanisms, and the code does not handle a 403 status.

C. 401 (Unauthorized): This status code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials. Similarly to 403, the code does not involve authentication, so 401 is not the expected status code.

D. 400 (Bad Request): This status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to a client error, such as malformed syntax in the request. However, the code in the snippet does not show any signs of sending a malformed request.

**B. 200(CORRECT)**
