Consider the following assertion statement: 
 
def authorizeAdmin(usr): 
    assert isinstance(usr, list) and usr != [], “No user found” 
    assert ‘admin’ in usr, “No admin found.” 
    print(“You are granted full access to the application.”) 
 
If __name__ == ‘__main__’: 
    authorizeAdmin([‘user’]) 
 
What should be the response after running the code? 
 
A. AssertionError: No admin found  (CORRECT)

B. AssertionError: No user found 

C. Authorized User 

D. You are granted full access to the application
